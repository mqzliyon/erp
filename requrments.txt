I have already implemented the CEO role, and now I want to add a new role called "Manager". Please update the app with the following requirements:

🔐 User Sign-Up:

Create a sign-up screen with the following four fields:

1. Email


2. Password


3. Confirm Password


4. Role Selection (Dropdown or Radio Button with options: CEO, Manager)



Make the role field required.

The selected role must be saved in Firebase Auth or Firestore along with the user account.



---

🧑‍💼 Role-Based Access:

CEO Role: Already implemented. Should retain full access to all menus and data.

Manager Role (new):

The Manager should only see data and UI relevant to their role.

Managers must not see any CEO data or CEO-only menus.




---

📱 Manager Role UI:

When a user with the Manager role logs in, show a Bottom Navigation Menu with only the following 3 items:

1. Rongdhonu Office (this should be the default selected tab)


2. Uttara Office


3. Payment Request



Each of these menu items should load a separate fragment or activity showing Manager-specific data.

The bottom navigation should not show CEO features or layouts.

✅ Additional Notes:

Use Firebase Authentication for login/signup.

Use Firestore to store and fetch user role and associated data.

Use proper condition checks after login to route the user to the appropriate dashboard based on their role (CEO or Manager).

Make sure role-based access is secure and data is not shared between roles.s
